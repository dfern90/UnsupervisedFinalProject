# UnsupervisedFinalProject

Customer Segmentation Project README
## Overview

This project aims to explore an unsupervised machine learning approach to customer segmentation. Customer segmentation involves dividing customers into groups based on shared characteristics, which proves beneficial for marketing strategies, brand positioning, and targeting potential consumers effectively.
Objectives

    Generate an unsupervised model for customer segmentation.
    Compare the unsupervised model with two alternatives.
    Fine-tune hyperparameters.
    Analyze and discuss the results obtained.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized for this project is the Customer Segmentation dataset sourced from JanataHack via Analytics Vidhya. This dataset, akin to a Kaggle competition dataset, eliminates the need for specialized data collection. The CSV files provided will be directly uploaded into the Jupyter notebook for analysis.
Problem Statement

An automobile company intends to enter new markets with existing products (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5). Extensive market research suggests similarities between the behavior of the new market and the existing market. In the company's current market, the sales team has categorized all customers into four segments (A, B, C, D). Leveraging segmented outreach and communication has proven successful. The objective is to apply the same strategy to new markets by identifying the right group among 2627 potential customers without labeled data.
Approach

This problem is approached as an unsupervised learning task. The goal is to segment customers into four distinct groups without access to labeled data for the testing dataset. The project workflow involves:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
    Building an unsupervised model (k-means clustering).
    Constructing alternative models (Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes Classifier).
    Analyzing model results and discussing findings.
    Evaluating the testing dataset performance by submitting predicted labels to Analytics Vidhya for accuracy assessment.
